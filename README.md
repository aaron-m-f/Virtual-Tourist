What is it?
===========

Virtual Tourist is a Udacity iOS Nanodegree project focused on implementing Core Data fundamentals in Swift.

Virtual Tourist allows users to plot locations on a map by pressing-and-holding on their preferred locations.  Users can then tap on those plots to pull up a collection of random Flickr photos from that general geographic locations.

Within the collection, users can delete photos or reload an entirely new collection.

Implementation
==============

In order to implement Virtual Tourist, you will need to get a Flickr API key and update the APIKey value in FlickrConstants.swift
